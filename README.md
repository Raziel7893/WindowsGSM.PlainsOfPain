# WindowsGSM.PlanesOfPain
🧩WindowsGSM plugin that provides PlanesOfPain Dedicated server

## PLEASE ⭐STAR⭐ THE REPO IF YOU LIKE IT! THANKS!

### Notes
- ServerName, Port and QueryPort are set via commandline. Its not really defined what happens if both define it, so i removed the port per default from the json.
- It is recommended to not use the default/custom configs, as they may be overwritten/reset by steam / update validate
  - So create/copy your own and set that by clicking Edit Config => and changing it in Server Start Param
- install everything inside _CommonRedist
- If there is an Error Popup on start you most likely are using an invalid or already used Port

### Connecting on a locked server (with password)
For now only Connecting via a the ingame serverbrowser is possible. It is recommended to note down the 5 Options after password and filter your servers accordingly (as there is no name filter either)
- On the left of the join window be sure to click public (not official)
- On the lower part choose your options to filter down the list of servers
- Be sure to favour your server, so they should show up under Favorites on the next time

### Other notes
- The game is currently in Early Access Stage WGSM and this plugin is not taking liability if something happens to your server, the app is only for managing your server easily

### Not having an full IPv4 adress ( named CCNAT or DSL Light )
No game or gameserver supports ipv6 only connections. 
- You need to either buy one (most VPN services provide that option. A pal uses ovpn.net for his server, I know of nordvpn also providing that. Should both cost around 7€ cheaper half of it, if your already having an VPN)
- Or you pay a bit more for your internet and take a contract with full ipv4. (depending on your country)
- There are also tunneling methods, which require acces to a server with a full ipv4. Some small VPS can be obtained, not powerfull enough for the servers themself, but only for forwarding. I think there are some for under 5€), the connection is then done via wireguard. but its a bit configuration heavy to setup) 

Or you connect your friends via VPN to your net and play via local lan then.
Many windowsgsm plugin creators recommend zerotier (should be a free VPN designated for gaming) , see chapter below (or tailscale, but no howto there)

## How can you play with your friends without port forwarding?
- Use [zerotier](https://www.zerotier.com/) folow the basic guide and create network
- Download the client app and join to your network
- Create static IP address for your host machine
- Edit WGSM IP Address to your recently created static IP address
- Give your network ID to your friends
- After they've joined to your network
- They can connect using the IP you've created eg: 10.123.17.1:7777
- Enjoy
